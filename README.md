# What is Tic-Tac-Toe?
Tic-tac-toe (also known as noughts and crosses or Xs and Os) is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. 

# Objective
The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
If none of the players succeed to do that and the grid is full, the game ends in a tie.

# Simple Variation in my code
Unlike traditional Tic-Tac-Toe, the 2 players can choose any symbol they want available on the keyboard, except the same symbol as the other player. Program will randomly decide which player goes first.
